# Setting filtering options for orthology and alignments:
# ---- Orthology results can be filtered based on two settings cutoff and minsp: ----
# cutoff = the minimum proportion of single-copy BUSCO sequences a sample needs to have for it to be included in subsequent analysis. Default: 0.5 (50% single copy BUSCOs)
# minsp = the minimum number of samples which need to have a specific BUSCO gene for the gene to be included in subsequent analysis. Default: 3 (at least three species need to have the gene)
# ---- Trimmed alignments can be additionally filtered ----
# dupseq = occasionally BUSCO will find more than one sequence for a single-copy BUSCO gene. With dupseq you can decide how this is handeled. dupseq="persample" for each busco filter out the samples with duplicated sequences. dubseq="perfile" filters out the BUSCO sequence file for that gene.
# min_parsimony_sites = the minimum number of parsiomony informative sites a trimmed alignment needs to have for it to be included in tree calculation.
