# Testcase for Orthofinder

This is a small testcase to run phylociraptor with Orthofinder to identify singly copy orthologs.
It is based on five protein sets of different *Mycoplasma* species.

## Steps to reproduce:

To run the testcase you have to copy the contents of this directory into the `data/` directory.

Run this inside the phylociraptor directory:

```
cp -r data/test-cases/orthofinder/* data/
```

Now you can proceed with `phylociraptor setup`.
