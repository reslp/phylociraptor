About
============

Phylociraptor is a bioinformatics pipeline to create **phylogenomic trees** for a specified set of species using different alignment, trimming and tree reconstruction methods. Installation is simple with only two dependencies. 
It is very scalable and runs on Linux/Unix machines, servers as well as HPC clusters. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Phylociraptor performs every step of a typical phylogenomic analysis.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* It automatically downloads genomes available on NCBI and combines them with additional specified genomes provided by the user. 
* It identifies single-copy orthologs for a set of genomes (locally provided or downloaded automatically).
* It creates alignments for single-copy genes.
* It allows to trim and filter alignments in various ways.
* It calculates gene-trees for each alignment.
* It creates a species tree from gene-trees using ASTRAL.
* It creates Neighbor-Joining trees using quicktree.
* It calculates the best substitution model for single-gene alignments.
* It automatically produces all input and runs iqtree and raxml to create concatenated Maximum-Likelihood phylogenies.
* It provides extensive reports for each analysis step combined in a single HTML file which can be viewed in a Web Browser.
* It provides multiple tools to analyze, compare and visualize phylogenetic trees.
* Most steps are highly parallelized and it is possible to get from a list of hundreds of taxa to a phylogenomic tree in a few days. 

---------------------------------------------
Phylociraptor has the following dependencies:
